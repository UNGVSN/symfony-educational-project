# Nginx Configuration for Front Controller
#
# This configuration sets up Nginx to work with our front controller pattern.
# All requests are directed to index.php unless they match a real file.
#
# How to use:
# 1. Save this as /etc/nginx/sites-available/framework-demo
# 2. Create symlink: ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/framework-demo /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
# 3. Test config: nginx -t
# 4. Reload: systemctl reload nginx

server {
    # Listen on port 80 (HTTP)
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;

    # Server name (change to your domain)
    server_name framework-demo.local;

    # Document root - MUST point to the public/ directory
    # This ensures application code is not web-accessible
    root /home/ungvsn/symfony-educational-project/framework-rebuild/02-front-controller/public;

    # Default index file
    index index.php;

    # Logging
    access_log /var/log/nginx/framework-demo-access.log;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/framework-demo-error.log;

    # Character encoding
    charset utf-8;

    # Main location block - handles all requests
    location / {
        # try_files directive:
        # 1. Try to serve the file directly ($uri)
        # 2. Try to serve as a directory ($uri/)
        # 3. Fall back to index.php with original request arguments
        #
        # $is_args is '?' if query string exists, empty otherwise
        # $args contains the query string
        #
        # Examples:
        # /products/123 → Try file, try dir, then index.php with REQUEST_URI=/products/123
        # /css/style.css → Served directly if file exists
        # /products?sort=name → Falls to index.php with query string preserved

        # Pass the original request URI to PHP
        fastcgi_param REQUEST_URI $request_uri;

    # Optional: Prevent access to backup and source files

# Optional: HTTPS configuration
# Uncomment and configure after obtaining SSL certificate (e.g., with Let's Encrypt)
#
# server {
#     listen 443 ssl http2;
#     listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
#
#     server_name framework-demo.local;
#
#     # SSL certificate paths (update with your certificate paths)
#     ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/framework-demo.local/fullchain.pem;
#     ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/framework-demo.local/privkey.pem;
#
#     # SSL configuration
#     ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
#     ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
#     ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
#
#     # ... (rest of configuration same as HTTP block above)
# }
#
# # Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
# server {
#     listen 80;
#     listen [::]:80;
#     server_name framework-demo.local;
#     return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
# }

# Development configuration with PHP built-in server
#
# For quick testing without Nginx, use PHP's built-in server:
#
# cd public
# php -S localhost:8000
#
# This automatically routes all requests to index.php if no file exists.
# Great for development, but NOT for production (single-threaded, slow).
